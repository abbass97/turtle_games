              Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! <br />
              <br />
              I am Saima, a data analyst with a passion for uncovering hidden
              insights and transforming them into actionable strategies. My
              unique blend of skills, honed through a diverse academic
              background spanning Biological Sciences, English Literature, and
              Multimedia Computing, allows me to approach data with a fresh
              perspective. I'm proficient in a variety of programming languages
              and data analysis tools, including Python, SQL, R, and Tableau.
              I'm also experienced in machine learning techniques, such as
              Sci-kit Learn, predictive analytics, sentiment analysis,
              regression models, clustering, Random Forest, Decision Trees, and
              NLP. I am a highly analytical and detail-oriented problem-solver
              with a proven ability to communicate complex data insights to both
              technical and non-technical audiences. I am also a strong
              collaborator and team player, with a passion for using data to
              drive positive change. <br />

              <br />

              In my free time, I enjoy reading fiction and tech blogs,
              experiment with new recipes and play badminton. I’m a strong
              advocate for data literacy and believe that everyone should have
              the opportunity to learn how to use data to make informed
              decisions. Whether through dashboards, predictive models, or
              storytelling, I aim to make data approachable, meaningful, and
              actionable. I’m especially passionate about using data to support
              better decision-making in business, healthcare, and education
              sectors where data has the power to drive real, human-centered
              impact.

          <p class="hero-text">
            My journey into data analysis began with a fascination for the power
            of data to tell stories and solve problems. I was particularly drawn
            to the ability of data to reveal hidden patterns and trends, and to
            provide insights that could be used to make better decisions.

            <br />

            However, this journey was anything but traditional! It started with
            a fascination for sciences, an appreciation for storytelling in
            literature, and a passion for problem-solving in computing. I have
            written about this unconventional journey in a

            </a>
            post, where I reflect on the turning points that brought me here.

            <br />
            Early on, I thrived in academia, earning degrees in Biological
            Sciences and English Literature, which sharpened my research and
            analytical skills. Later, intrigued by the ubiquitous nature of
            technology, I explored Multimedia Computing which provided me with a
            strong foundation in programming (Java, PHP, SQL), data mining, and
            software design, complemented by creative projects in web
            development and multimedia systems. Before acquiring my degree in
            Multimedia Computing, I worked as primary class teacher and teaching
            assistant in different schools across different countries. This
            experience not only enhanced my communication and collaboration
            skills, which allow me to engage effectively with diverse teams and
            stakeholders, but it also gave me an opportunity to analyse
            students’ progress and make data-driven decisions without realising!

            <br />
            This rich experience, combined with the specialised training in Data
            Analytics at LSE which I completed with distinction in November 2024
            solidified my path. At LSE, I completed hands-on projects across
            finance, healthcare, and retail, applying exploratory data analysis,
            sentiment analysis, predictive analytics, machine learning
            frameworks (Scikit-learn), and data visualisation tools to
            real-world datasets.
            <br />

            I blend my technical skills with a creative, storytelling approach
            to turn raw data into meaningful insights. I’m passionate about
            working with organisations that value data-driven decision-making
            and innovative solutions.
